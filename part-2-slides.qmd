## What are inferential statistics?

:::{.notes}
At the beginning of the course, we saw that one of the main aims of statistics is to make inferences about a target population of interest based on results of analysis applied to a random sample. These inferences require inferential statistics,

## What are inferential statistics?

Inferential statistics make inferences about target population based on a [random, representative sample]{.answer}

[Combine sample estimates with [sample size]{.answer} and [level of precision]{.answer}]{.fragment}

[Most common inferential statistics: [p-values]{.answer} and [confidence intervals]{.answer}]{.fragment}

:::{.notes}
These are estimated by combining results from the random, representative sample taken from the target population, and information about the sample size and precision of the sample estimate.

## Measures of precision

Precision of an estimate quantified by [standard error (SE)]{.answer}

[Based on sample size and sample variability]{.fragment}

:::{.notes}
Inferential statistics require a measure of how precise a sample estimate is. Precision is quanti􀏐ied using the standard error (SE), calculated using the sample size and sample variability. The formula used to calculate a standard error depends on the type of parameter we wish to obtain from the target.
For example, the standard error of a single mean (𝑆𝐸(𝑥)̄ ) is found by dividing the sample standard deviation (𝑆𝐷) by the square root of the sample size (𝑛):
