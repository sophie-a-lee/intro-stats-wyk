In this course, we will not focus on analysis methods. Instead, we will be focusing on thinking statistically.\nStatistical thinking involves describing data and complex systems in relatively simple terms whilst acknowledging uncertainty that exists. The process of statistical thinking involves critically appraising available data, identifying patterns using visualisations and summaries, and communicating results in a clear, concise manner. Statistical thinking could be thought of as data-driven critical thinking."

The simplest way to do this is to count the number of observations that lie in each group, as we have seen previously displayed in frequency tables. However, a simple count can be difficult to interpret without proper context. Often, we wish to present these counts relative to the total sample that they are taken from.\nThe proportion of observations in a given group is estimated as the number in the group divided by the total sample size. This gives a value between 0 and 1. Multiplying the proportion by 100 will give the percentage in each group, taking the value between 0 and 100%. In cases where the proportion and percentage in a given group is very small, we may wish to multiply the proportions by a larger number to make values easier to interpret. These values are known as rates and are interpreted as the value per the number multiplied by. For example, if the proportion in a group was 0.0005, this could be multiplied by 10,000 to give a rate of 5 per 10,000."

The simplest way to do this is to count the number of observations that lie in each group, as we have seen previously displayed in frequency tables. However, a simple count can be difficult to interpret without proper context. Often, we wish to present these counts relative to the total sample that they are taken from.\nThe proportion of observations in a given group is estimated as the number in the group divided by the total sample size. This gives a value between 0 and 1. Multiplying the proportion by 100 will give the percentage in each group, taking the value between 0 and 100%. In cases where the proportion and percentage in a given group is very small, we may wish to multiply the proportions by a larger number to make values easier to interpret. These values are known as rates and are interpreted as the value per the number multiplied by. For example, if the proportion in a group was 0.0005, this could be multiplied by 10,000 to give a rate of 5 per 10,000."

The relative difference (1,239,000 / 1,841,000) is 0.673, so there were 0.673 times the number of crimes reported in 2020 than 2010. This result is not intuitive, so converting the difference into a percentage decrease can make the value easier to interpret. As with an increase, we first find the difference between the relative difference and the null (1 - 0.673). This gives a proportion decrease of 0.327 or a percentage decrease of 32.7%. Therefore, there were 32.7% fewer violent crimes reported in 2020 compared to 2010."
